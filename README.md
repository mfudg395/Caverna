# Caverna

Caverna is a small prototype developed by Matthew Fudge, Nahuel Paladino, and Anthony Dang as a term project for COMP-4555 at Mount Royal University.

The game is a simple 2D action-platformer with platforming challenges, basic enemies, and some light combat mechanics. It was developed in Godot over the course of the Winter 2022 semester. Here are some screenshots of the game!
